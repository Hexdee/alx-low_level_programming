## Debugging
The aim of this project is to show that I've the method of debugging manually and how to read the error messages

## Files presents
There is one header file and four c files in this directory

### `main.h`
The header that contains my function prototypes

### `0-main.c`
Test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.

### `1-main.c`
I commented out the line causing an infinite loop in this file

### `2-largest_number.c`
I fixed the program so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

### `3-print_remaining_days.c`
I fixed the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
