## C - More functions, more nested loops
The aim of this project is to show that I've understood nested loops, function declaration and prototype, variables scopes, gcc flags (`-Wall` `-Werror` `-pedantic` `-Wextra` `-std=gnu89`), header files and how to use `#include`.

## Files presents
There are twelve c files in this directory and one header file in this directory

### `main.h`
The header that contains my function prototypes

### `0-isupper.c`
ontains `_isupper()`, a function that checks for uppercase character.

### `1-isdigit.c`
Contains `_isdigit()`, a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).

### `2-mul.c`
Contains `mul()`, a function that multiplies two integers.

### `3-print_remaining_days.c`
I fixed the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
